"""Bridge a pty to a playground's console websocket.

ttyd runs this as its command, handing it a real pty. Everything typed on that
pty is forwarded to the playground's console, and everything the playground
emits is written back. One bridge works for every backend -- container, QEMU
and Firecracker -- because they all publish through the same console hub, and
because ttyd starts a fresh copy per browser connection, several people can
attach at once without fighting over a single serial line.
